# Singapore-Localized Voice Finance Tracker

## Overview

Voice Finance Tracker is a production-ready Singapore-localized expense tracking application that uses voice commands to log expenses. The application features a seamless demo mode that works without any configuration while supporting optional real speech-to-text integration.

## Architecture Evolution

The application has evolved through multiple phases to become a market-ready product:

1. **Initial Reset**: Removed authentication complexity to focus on core product value
2. **Core Implementation**: Built voice recording, speech-to-text, and transaction management
3. **Singapore Localization**: Added comprehensive local context and keywords
4. **Seamless UX**: Abstracted technical configuration from users

## Current Architecture

### Local-First with Singapore Optimization
- **Primary Storage**: Browser localStorage with Zustand state management
- **Demo Mode**: Singapore-specific mock transcriptions when API unavailable
- **Real Mode**: Deepgram speech-to-text with enhanced local parsing
- **Cultural Context**: 480+ Singapore keywords across Food, Transport, Shopping, Utilities

### Technology Stack
```
Frontend: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS 4
State: Zustand with localStorage persistence
Audio: MediaRecorder API + Web Audio API
Speech: Deepgram Nova-2 with Singapore context
UI: shadcn/ui + Framer Motion + Lucide React
```

## Singapore Localization Features

### Local Context Recognition
```typescript
// 480+ keywords across categories
Food: ['chicken rice', 'laksa', 'bak kut teh', 'kaya toast', 'bubble tea']
Transport: ['mrt', 'grab', 'ez-link', 'erp', 'coe']
Shopping: ['ntuc fairprice', 'ion orchard', 'vivocity', 'shopee']
Utilities: ['sp group', 'singtel', 'town council', 'cpf']
```

### Voice Command Examples
- "I spent $5 on chicken rice at Maxwell Food Centre"
- "MRT fare $2.50 to Orchard Road"
- "Bubble tea at Gong Cha $4.80"
- "Grab to Marina Bay Sands $15"

## Seamless User Experience

### Demo Mode Implementation
```typescript
// Graceful API fallback
if (!hasValidDeepgramKey) {
  const demoTranscripts = [
    "I spent twelve dollars on chicken rice at Maxwell Food Centre",
    "Bought bubble tea for five dollars at Gong Cha",
    "MRT fare two dollars and fifty cents"
  ]
  return parseSingaporeTransaction(randomTranscript)
}
```
